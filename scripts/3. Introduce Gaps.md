### Here we analyze how the gaps affect the detection of relaxed selection of CYP8B1 by 'RELAX' in terms of :
- number of gaps
- length of gaps 
- number of species

### About CYP8B1 gene :

| Names | CYP8B1 cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 |
|       |   ----                                               |
|       | CYP12                                                |
|            
|

To introduce gaps we used the `bedtools`.
