### Here we analyze how the gaps affect the detection of relaxed selection of CYP8B1 by 'RELAX' in terms of :
- number of gaps
- length of gaps 
- number of species

### About CYP8B1 gene :


To introduce gaps we used the `bedtools`.

- Select the species to introduce gaps and run RELAX.
  - Afrotheria can be used - since they show strong relaxed selection on CYP8B1 [Shinde et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-019-09903-6?fbclid=IwAR2UL_uHcWkEfqa1GyJsq95N_t_Lcaq7TOn1UpFVNj-2ikDJnUEbHi0ZBCQ#Sec2). 
    - There were only 7 Afrothrtia species used in Shinde's study.
    - Gaps 'replace' (not 'insert' - which will change reading frame) random nucleotides with N's.
    - Even before introducing gaps - there were total 16 N's already present in the sequence of 2 species.
      - 13 N's in Loxodonta africana (3 triplets + 1 nt)
      - 3 N's in Tricheus manatus latirostris (1 triplet)
    - These N's are also gaps - but are introduced before ORF validation to facilitate alignment.
    - Hence these N's are considered normal w.r.t gaps N's that we introduce in this step.
